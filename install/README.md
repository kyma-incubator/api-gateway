# Installation guide

This directory contains two methods of installation for the controller. 

## Static manifests
The `k8s` directory contains static kubernetes manifests generated by kubebuilder. They can be used to quickly deploy a simple installation of the controller (deployment, RBAC). 
To install simply run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s
```

## Helm chart
The `helm` directory contains a helm chart for the Gateway controller. It consists of the following elements:
- CustomResourceDefinition managed by a job (for installation and upgrade)
- Controller deployment
- RBAC settings

To install simply run:

```bash
helm install --name gatekeeper --namespace some-namespace helm/api-gateway
```
